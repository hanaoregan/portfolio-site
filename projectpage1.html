          <h4>Immor(t)ality: You Don't Really Want It</h4><br>

          <p>I designed this book as a counter-argument to the pursuit of immortality. The cover explores the relationship between "immortality" and "immorality," which are linked closely both in spelling and, I believe, in concept.<br><br>The book is divided into four sections, all of which discuss the different negative ways that immortality could affect the earth, as well as humankind. The book is further differentiated by type of text&mdash;essays are on the largest paper, then fiction, and the essays are the smallest. Each is printed on its own type of paper and each is set in its own typeface. The point of this was to allow the reader different points of entry, based on the interest level.</p><br><p class="medium"><strong>Medium:</strong> paper, glue, book board</p><span class="date">2015</span>
